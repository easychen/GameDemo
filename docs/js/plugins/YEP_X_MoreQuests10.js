 * ============================================================================
 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin requires YEP_QuestJournal. Make sure this plugin is located
 * under YEP_X_MoreQuests10 in the plugin list.
 *
 * By default, the YEP_QuestJournal plugin comes with 100 quest entries that
 * you can make and insert into your game. And depending on the RPG being made,
 * 100 quest entries just might not be enough. This plugin is a part of a
 * series of extension plugins made for the Yanfly Engine Plugins Quest Journal
 * System to allow for a higher quest quantity than just 100.
 *
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests1 will add quests 101 to 1000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests2 will add quests 1001 to 2000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests3 will add quests 2001 to 3000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests4 will add quests 3001 to 4000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests5 will add quests 4001 to 5000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests6 will add quests 5001 to 6000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests7 will add quests 6001 to 7000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests8 will add quests 7001 to 8000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests9 will add quests 8001 to 9000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests10 will add quests 9001 to 10000.
 *
 * These extension plugins also come with a new feature: automatic batch data.
 * For every set of 100 quests, you can set a default type, difficulty, from,
 * and location data for them. Quest entries that have |-=AUTO=-| in those
 * respective fields will draw data from the batch set's default data. How you
 * wish to use this will be up to you!
